\title{Etimate average treatment effect (ATE) with
inverse propensity score weighting.}
\usage{
ipw_ate(data, y, w, p, cf = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a dataframe object containing the variables and values.}

\item{y}{a character vector specifying the response variable.}

\item{w}{a character vector specifying the treatment status.}

\item{p}{a vector containing propensity score values.}

\item{cf}{logical; if TRUE then includes confidence interval on ATE.}
}
\value{
a list of ATE, 95 percent confidence interval upperbound and lowerbound or just ATE, depending on user input of \code{cf}
}
\description{
Etimate average treatment effect (ATE) with
inverse propensity score weighting.
}
\details{
Computes an estimate of the ATE \eqn{\tau} using propensity score weighting: 
\deqn{\tau = E \left[ \frac{Y_i W_i}{e(X_i)} - \frac{Y_i (1 - W_i)}{1 - e(X_i)} \right]}
where \eqn{e(X_i) = P(W_i = 1 | X_i = x)} is the propensity score.
}
\examples{
data("lalonde")

# calculate propensity scores
p <- propensity_score(data = lalonde, y = "re78", w = "treat", model = "logistic")
ate <- ipw_ate(data = lalonde, y = "re78", w = "treat", p = p)
